# Verilated -*- CMake -*-
# DESCRIPTION: Verilator output: CMake include script with class lists
#
# This CMake script lists generated Verilated files, for including in higher level CMake scripts.
# This file is meant to be consumed by the verilate() function,
# which becomes available after executing `find_package(verilator).

### Constants...
set(PERL "perl" CACHE FILEPATH "Perl executable (from $PERL)")
set(VERILATOR_ROOT "/usr/share/verilator" CACHE PATH "Path to Verilator kit (from $VERILATOR_ROOT)")

### Compiler flags...
# User CFLAGS (from -CFLAGS on Verilator command line)
set(Vcfu_USER_CFLAGS )
# User LDLIBS (from -LDFLAGS on Verilator command line)
set(Vcfu_USER_LDLIBS )

### Switches...
# SystemC output mode?  0/1 (from --sc)
set(Vcfu_SC 0)
# Coverage output mode?  0/1 (from --coverage)
set(Vcfu_COVERAGE 0)

set(Vcfu_TRACE_VCD 0)
# FST Tracing output mode? 0/1 (from --fst-trace)
set(Vcfu_TRACE_FST 0)
